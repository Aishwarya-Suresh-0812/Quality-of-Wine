# Prediction-of-wine-quality
Machine learning model (KNN Classification) to predict quality of wine.

In this project, through the classification of the target variable 'Quality' by various features of the wine quality dataset, we predict how good a red-wine is.
Later developed a user interface to take inputs from user to enter new values for the feature to determine the quility of that specific composition.
